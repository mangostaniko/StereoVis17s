Implementation of a local stereo matching algorithm based on [2005 Yoon, Kweon: Locally Adaptive Support-Weight Approach for Visual Correspondence Search] in C++ using OpenCV. Although this paper is rather old and many newer algorithms produce far better results, it is still relevant as its idea builds the basis for many other works. 

task1: introduction to OpenCV
task2: implementation of a simple window-based stereo matching algorithm using cost volumes
task3: improving the algorithm using a weight function and an additional refinement step
